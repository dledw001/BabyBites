# Onboarding

1. clone the repo and cd BabyBites

2. start a python virtual environment
    `python -m venv .venv`

3. activate the python virtual environment
    `source .venv/bin/activate`

4. install dependencies
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. launch the backend server
    `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080`

6. go to localhost:8080 in a web browser
    - i find it helpful to use the private browsing or incognito option to avoid caching issues
    - i also find it useful to pull up the development tools window (F12 should bring it up)
    - also, if your phone is on the same network as your pc, you can pull up the website on your phone at your-pcs-local-ip:8080 in a browser
