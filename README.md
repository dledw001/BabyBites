## The Problem
One problem that comes to mind when considering societal problems is one that I am currently experiencing and that many people may not think about until they are dealing with it. That problem is the incredibly important yet challenging stage of transitioning a baby from milk to solid foods and, later, from pureed solids to more complex meals appropriate for toddlers. While this may seem like a simple transition, it is far from that.
Most babies begin transitioning to solids around 6 months of age[1][2], starting with pureed foods before moving to more solid textures. However, every baby is different, and many factors must be considered, such as potential allergies. Another issue, especially for first time parents, is not knowing what foods are safe at various stages, how to prepare the food to prevent choking, and when to introduce utensils like spoons and forks.
