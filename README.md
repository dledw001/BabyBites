# BabyBites

Shouldn't feeding your child be simpler and less stressful? BabyBites is designed to help you navigate the transition from milk to solids and beyond. It removes the uncertainty from feeding with expert resources and alert notifications, ensuring your child’s meals are safe and nutritious.

## The Problem
The process of transitioning a baby from milk to solid foods and eventually, to more complex meals appropriate for toddlers is a crucial, yet challenging, phase for many parents and caregivers. 
Typically, babies begin this transition around six months, starting with pureed foods before gradually moving to more textured solids.[^1] This can be overwhelming for parents and caregivers, as it can be difficult to know which foods are safe at various stages, how to prepare them, and when to introduce certain utensils.
This transition goes beyond simply feeding, it is about fostering safe, balanced nutrition while supporting babies and toddlers in developing essential eating skills and independence.
