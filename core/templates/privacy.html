                    This Privacy Policy explains how BabyBites collects, uses, and protects information
                    about you and your child when you use our service.
                </p>

                <h5>1. Information we collect</h5>
                <p>
                    We collect account information (such as your email address) and baby profile data
                    you enter into the app (such as name, date of birth, and feeding information).
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">2. How we use your information</h5>
                <p>
                    We use this information to provide core BabyBites features, such as tracking
                    feedings, generating daily reports, and displaying insights in your dashboard.
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">3. Data sharing</h5>
                <p>
                    We do not sell your data. We only share information with service providers as needed
                    to operate the application (for example, hosting and infrastructure).
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">4. Data retention</h5>
                <p>
                    We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion
                    of your account and associated data by contacting us.
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">5. Security</h5>
                <p>
                    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, but
                    no system is 100% secure.
