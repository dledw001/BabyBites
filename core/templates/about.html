                    BabyBites is a simple, focused app that helps parents track what their baby eats,
                    when they eat, and how they react to new foods.
                </p>

                <h5>Why we built it</h5>
                <p>
                    Introducing solids can be overwhelming. BabyBites gives you a single place to log
                    feedings, reactions, and milestones so you don’t have to juggle notes, spreadsheets,
                    or half-remembered details.
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">What BabyBites does</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Track daily feedings by food, portion size, and reaction.</li>
                    <li>Generate simple daily reports you can review or share.</li>
                    <li>Highlight “first time” foods and other basic milestones.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="mt-3">What BabyBites is not</h5>
                <p>
                    BabyBites is not a medical app and does not replace your pediatrician. It’s a
                    record-keeping tool meant to support your own judgment and conversations with
                    healthcare professionals.
                </p>
